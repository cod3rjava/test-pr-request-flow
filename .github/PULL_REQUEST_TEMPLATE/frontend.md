## ‚úÖ Frontend Checklist
- [ ] My changes build and run successfully in dev.
- [ ] I verified cross-browser and responsive behavior.
- [ ] Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav, color contrast) verified.
- [ ] No unused imports, console logs, or debug code remain.
- [ ] All UI text is internationalized (i18n) if applicable.

## ‚öõÔ∏è Effects Sanity Check

- [ ] If I added an effect, it connects React to an **external system** (network, storage, timers, subscriptions, DOM imperative work).
- [ ] This logic could not be handled at the **event boundary** (e.g., `onOpenChange`, router action).
- [ ] For data fetching I used **React Query/SWR** with `enabled`/`queryKey` instead of manual effects.
- [ ] I did **not** mirror props to local state. Any computed value is derived (`useMemo`/variable), not synced.
- [ ] I am **not** using `useLayoutEffect` (or this file is in the allowed folder for measurement/focus).
- [ ] Dependency arrays are minimal and stable (no unstable function identities unless memoized for a reason).
